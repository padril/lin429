- Rogers & Heinz. 2014. "Model Theoretic Phonology". ESSLLI Talk.

This is the main theory I will use for my analysis. This is not the only
resource I will use to teach myself it, or reference, but it is very
comprehensive.

- Tesar. 2013. "Output-Driven Phonology: Theory and Learning". Cambridge
  University Press.
- Lambert & Heinz. 2024. "Algebraic Reanalysis of Phonological Processes
  Described as Output-Oriented". ACL.

Tesar (2013) is another important theory I'll probably end up using a lot of.
Highly connected to model theoretic phonology through Lambert & Heinz (2024).

- Chandlee. 2014. "Strictly Local Phonological Processes". Dissertation.

This too, and Chandlee's other works on Input Strictly Local phonology and
$k$-local phonology. Highly connected to model theoretic phonology. The
chapter on metathesis is especially interesting to me, because something about
the copy-delete analysis does not sit right with me.

- Baković & Blumenfeld. 2024. "A formal typology of process interactions".
  Phonological Data and Analysis.
- Chandlee, Heinz & Jardine. 2018. "Input Strictly Local opaque maps"

Baković & Blumenfeld (2024) is a landmark connection between computational
phonology and opacity. Chandlee, Heinz & Jardine (2018) directly relates input
strictly local theory to opacity. These papers will both be super useful for
linking the two.

- Kager. 1999b. "Surface opacity of metrical structure in Optimality Theory".
  The Derivational Residue in Phonological Optimality Theory.

This will help me understand how metathesis fits into opacity, which doesn't
seem intuitive to me (especially under a copy-delete analysis).

- Chandlee. 2012. "Bounded copying is subsequential: Implications for
  metathesis and reduplication". SIGMORPHON.
- Heinz. 2005a. "Reconsidering Linearity: Evidence from CV Metathesis".
  Proceedings of the 24th West Coast Conference on Formal Linguistics.

Metathesis analyzed copmutationally and with model theoretic phonology.

- Walker. 1998. "Nasalization, Neutral Segments, and Opacity Effects".
  Dissertation.

I have no idea yet about this one, but nearly every paper above has referenced
it.

I don't think I'll be using any data yet. Not sure.

I'm still not 100% sure about what the main points of my paper will be, but
I'm hoping to find a gap in the literature somewhere in the above paper.
There's definitely something missing connecting copy-delete metathesis and the
view of metathesis through opacity, but I'm not sure yet if that would be
signficiant enough to warrant a full paper. I will read though all of this
literature (and more) over the reading week and have a better idea of where my
paper is going by the end of it.
