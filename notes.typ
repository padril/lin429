- Ewan's 2014 work on cyclic opacity uses FSTs, I'll ask him about it
  tomorrow.
- Karttunen showed a classical OT system can be translated into a finite state
  transducer
  - Frank and Satta did work on this too
  - This might not be directly relevant, but is a must read for this project
- Johnson (1972) and Kaplan & Kay (1994) showed similar results for rule based
  phonology
- Kaplan showed that a cascade of finite state transducers can be compiled
  into an equivalent single finite state transducer
  - This is the formalism I'd use to explore opacity
- The property of being Input Strictly Local, introduced in Chandlee (2014)
  and expanded on in Chandlee, Heinz & Jardine (2018) related BakoviÄ‡'s 2007
  typology of opacity to computational approaches.
