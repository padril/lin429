# LIN429

This is a repository containing notes, code, figures, and eventually, a paper
for LIN429 (Research in Phonology) which I'm taking in Fall of 2025 at the
University of Toronto, and taught by Dr. Peter Jurgec.

...currently pretty empty.

## Research topic

Chumash opacity leads generalizations about phonotactics in languages with
similar opacity, argued using Multi-tiered strictly local languages.

## Typst

I love this little language, its significantly superior to LaTeX, but its
adoption is poor for journals, and notably the ArXiv. I'll use LaTeX for drafts
and the final write-up, but Typst for all of my notes.
