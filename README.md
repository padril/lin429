# LIN429

This is a repository containing notes, code, figures, and eventually, a paper
for LIN429 (Research in Phonology) which I'm taking in Fall of 2025 at the
University of Toronto, and taught by Dr. Peter Jurgec.

...currently pretty empty.

## Research topic

Can we describe opacity, theoretically, with FSTs? What insights can we gain
when we do? This project is on the intersection between opacity and finite state
transducers. Finite state transducers have been used a lot in the literature to
formally describe both rule-based and OT phonology, but have been related to
opacity almost nowhere. My first step is to familiarize myself with all of the
available literature and answer as many of the questions as I can from my post
here https://piazza.com/class/mepxps5egjp5c3/post/17. If I can answer all of
them, that's probably worth a final paper in itself, but more likely I'll find
something really interesting in the process.

Please see `notes.typ` for the beginning of a literature review.

## Typst

I love this little language, its significantly superior to LaTeX, but its
adoption is poor for journals, and notably the ArXiv. I'll use LaTeX for drafts
and the final write-up, but Typst for all of my notes.
