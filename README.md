# LIN429

This is a repository containing notes, code, figures, and eventually, a paper
for LIN429 (Research in Phonology) which I'm taking in Fall of 2025 at the
University of Toronto, and taught by Dr. Peter Jurgec.

...currently pretty empty.

## Research topic

Can we describe opacity, theoretically, with FSTs? What insights can we gain
when we do? Refer to https://piazza.com/class/mepxps5egjp5c3/post/17 for more
discussion.
